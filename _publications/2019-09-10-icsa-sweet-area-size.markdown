We compare the extent of the usable audience area of two algorithms that produce
diffusely enveloping, multi-channel surround playback from a single-channel input. The FIR
approach designs a set of random group-delay allpass filters to generate a set of
minimally correlated playback signals. Canfield-Dafilou presented a frequency-dependent
maximum group delay value as a constraint to keep audible artifacts small, in studio
environments. To enlarge the audience area in which an enveloping and diffuse listening
experience is achieved, we relax this constraint while having to accept an unavoidable
impression of spaciousness and reverberation. Consequently, the FIR approach naturally
competes with IIR feedback-delay network as alternative approach. We conduct listening
experiments to reveal quality and effectiveness of both methods, in particular regarding
sweet area size and sound quality.
