With distributed signal processing gaining traction in the audio and speech processing
landscape through the utilization of interconnected devices constituting wireless acoustic
sensor networks, additional challenges arise, including optimal data transmission between
devices. In this paper, we extend an adaptive distributed blind system identification
algorithm by introducing a residual-based adaptive coding scheme to minimize communication
costs within the network. We introduce a coding scheme that takes advantage of the
convergence of estimates, i.e., vanishing residuals, to minimize information being sent.
The scheme is adaptive, i.e., tracks changes in the estimated system and utilizes entropy
coding and adaptive gain to fit the time-varying residual variance to pre-trained
codebooks. We use a low-complexity approach for gain adaptation, based on a recursive
variance estimate. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness with numerical simulations
and its performance in various scenarios.
